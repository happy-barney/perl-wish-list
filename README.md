# Perl wish-list

Summary of misc ideas how to improve Perl.

Having such ideas on single place prevents repeating same idea or idea
with known blocker over and over as well as identifying such blockers and
possibly solve them.

It may be treated as "just another PPC" - but with things I'm missing
in PPC process

- compare idea with similar behaviour in other languages as much as possible
  (opportunity for me to learn as well)
- notifying synergies between ideas
- decomposing implementation into "jira-like" granularity
- with discussions
  - each should be prefixed with idea name
